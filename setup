Task:
1. Loading keras ( already at CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project) another to fix at (keras) environment
2. doing classification problem using keras
3. http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/
4. Revisting P1 and P2
5. GPU to set

#"carnd-term1 " enviroment is created with GPU
1. Set up your environment with the Udacity CarND Starter Kit:https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit
            carnd-term1 environment created
2. Clone the repository containing the code.git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Alexnet-Feature-Extraction
            cd CarND-Alexnet-Feature-Extraction
(carnd-term1) octo@octo:~/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/CarND-Alexnet-Feature-Extraction$ 
3. Download the training data and AlexNet weights. (loaded at desktop)

Make sure the downloaded files are in the code directory as the code.
Open the code in your favorite editor.

6. AlexNet was originally trained on the ImageNet database.http://www.image-net.org/
then to trained for http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news
