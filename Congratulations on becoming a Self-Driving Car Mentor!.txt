Hello!

Congratulations on becoming a Self-Driving Car Mentor! We are just completing the process of getting you set up. You will soon receive an invitation to the Udacity Mentor Slack team; please sign up and join channels with a #sdcnd- prefix (e.g., #sdcnd-reviews, #sdcnd-general, etc.). We will be using this Slack team to stay connected with Mentors, and we look forward to seeing you there! 

Please feel free to reach out to me (@stephen) if you have any questions after you join.

Best,

Stephen
